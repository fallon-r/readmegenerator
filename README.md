## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

~~This currently only generates a readme in the source directory. In the future, I'd like to add a way to out put the readme to a folder of your choosing so that it will have more utility for other projects.~~

**Update-** This has been addressed, at least in some capacity. I have added an export directory so that you can generate a README that will go somewhere else.  At this time, it caters to Node projects. The next step for this project is to work on different paths for types of projects.

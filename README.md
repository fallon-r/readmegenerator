## Installation

## Usage

This currently only generates a readme in the source. In the future, I'd like to add a way to out put the readme to a folder of your choosing so that it will have more utility for other projects.

=======
This readme will ultimately  be generated by this application. Due to a few strange name changes, the changes that should add the github user image etc are currently sitting in the Axios branch.
